# tail-sitter-vtol-uav
This repository presents the conceptual design and preliminary aerodynamic analysis of a tail-sitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on a flying-wing configuration. The project focuses on aerodynamic efficiency, geometric simplicity, and suitability for conceptual-level analysis.
